# Graphical integrity issues in open access publications: detection and patterns of proportional ink violations
A deep learning-based provess to measure violations of the proportional ink principle. The specific rules are: a bar chartâ€™s y-axis should start from zero, have one scale, and not be partially hidden (Bergstrom & West, 2020; Tufte, 2001). The AUC of the method is 0.917 with 0.02 standard deviation and 0.77 precision wiht 0.0209 based on 5-fold cross-validation.
